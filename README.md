# Manjoot Narwal - AND Coding Challenge (L1L2)
## Description

I hope you are well! In this zip you will find my submission for the AND Coding Challenge.

The Language of Choice for this challenge is JavaScript.

### Problem

Two non-negative integers are called AND-Siblings if they can be obtained by each other by rearranging the digits of their decimal representations.

Write the function:

```javascript
function solution (input) {
	// logic here
	return null;
}
```

that, given any String input, returns all the distinct AND-Siblings that can be formed by the positive integers that can be found on it in descending order.


## Requirements

To run this JavaScript file in a terminal, you will only require Node.js and a package manager such as npm or yarn.

## How to run
Firstly, unzip the file **manjoot.narwal-L1L2_challenge.zip** (if you haven't already).

Then, using a terminal of your choice; set the path to where file is located (using cd):

```bash
cd manjoot.narwal-L1L2_challenge
```

Now you can run the file directly, by using the following command:
```bash
node manjoot.narwal-L1L2_challenge.js
```
